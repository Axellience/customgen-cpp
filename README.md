## GenMyModel Integration

You can directly integrate this generator into GenMyModel using custom generators.

Clic on `Tools` then `Custom generator`. Add a custom gen and enter the following keys:

    Generator name: CPPGEN (or whatever you want actually)
    Github URL:     https://github.com/Axellience/customgen-cpp.git
    Github branch:  master (not required)
   
As this generator is public on Github, there is no need to enter login information.
Do not forget to save it and that's all.
You are good to go! You can launch the generator and download the code source (`zip` format).
